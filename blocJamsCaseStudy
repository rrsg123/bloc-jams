# H1 Bloc Jams Case Study

## H2 Summary
When starting your first web development project with no experience, piecing it all together can be quite challenging. Bloc Jams was a vessel that helped consolidate the total lack of expeirence with a guided structure, allowing for creative learning.

## H2 Explanation
This project started as the first major project in my Bloc program. While the expected user can be anyone browsing the web/looking for a music player, the intended user was myself, making tiny tweaks and seeing what those changes did.

## H2 Problem
The issue was creating a useable web application that allowed for seamless streaming of music, as such a service had not existed before.

## H2 Solution
We built a web application, following the guidance of bloc's instructions, to create what was desired by the user - a streamable, free music player.

## H2 Results
While the selection of songs is limited, the player worked as intended.

## H2 Conclusion
After several attempts of launching the application, Bloc Jams eventually worked and played music as intended. Several struggles were faced initially when launching, but with proper guidance, the application worked.
